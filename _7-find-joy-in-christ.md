Find joy in Christ

Choices matter. Choices based on gospel teachings are steps that
lead you closer to your Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Jesus
said, “These things have I spoken unto you, … that your joy might
be full” (John 15:11). With each step toward Him, you will feel
closer to the Spirit and your covenant relationship with God will
become stronger.

But that doesn’t mean the path will be problem-free. And since no
one walks a perfectly straight line, constantly check your direction
and honor God’s commandments. Keep your covenants with God
and prepare to make more. Covenants connect you to Heavenly
Father and the Savior. They increase God’s power in your life and
prepare you to receive eternal life.

Of all possible choices, the one that matters most is the choice to
follow Jesus Christ. He is the strength of youth. His gospel is the
joyful way back to your Heavenly Father.

# Jesus Christ will help you

Psalm 147:3

Jesus Christ is your strength. He has done everything necessary for you to have
joy in this life and forever. By choosing Him and His gospel, you are choosing
eternal joy.

Even when you try to do your best to make good choices, sometimes you will make
mistakes. You’ll do things you wish you hadn’t. Everyone does. When that
happens, it is easy to feel discouraged or wonder if you will ever be good
enough. But there is good news—wonderful, hopeful news! Because God loves you,
He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, who took upon Himself your sins so you can
repent and keep progressing.

## Eternal Truths

Jesus Christ can strengthen you. He can help you change your desires, your
thoughts, and your actions. When you are worried, afraid, or struggling in any
way, He will comfort you. He will help you in all aspects of your life.

Repentance isn’t punishment for sin; it is the way the Savior frees us from
sin. To repent means to change—to turn away from sin and toward God. It means
to improve and receive forgiveness. This kind of change is not a one-time
event; it’s an ongoing process.

## Invitations

Repent. Turn to the Lord with the desire to improve. When you’ve done something
wrong, honestly admit it before God and, as needed, to your bishop and anyone
you may have harmed. Do your best to make things right.

Rejoice in the gift to do better and be better. Even when it is not easy and
takes longer than you’d like, never stop trying. Keep working and trusting in
the Lord. The Savior will help you every step of the way.

## Promised Blessings

Jesus Christ will forgive and heal you as you repent. He will replace your
guilt with peace and joy. He will remember your sins no more. In His strength,
your desire to keep His commandments will increase.

He will change your heart and your life. Little by little, you will grow and
become more like Him. Your covenant connection with Him will bring you greater
access to His power.

## Questions and Answers

How do I know if God has forgiven me? God promises He will forgive those who
repent. When you feel comfort from the Spirit, you can know that the Savior’s
atoning power is working in your life.

When do I need the help of the bishop to repent? Your bishop holds priesthood
keys and spiritual gifts to help you repent. You can seek his help and counsel
at any time. If you have made serious mistakes, such as breaking the law of
chastity, meet with your bishop. He won’t condemn you. He is a representative
of Jesus Christ and will help you know how to fully repent and receive the
Savior’s healing and strengthening power.

I’m trying to repent, but I keep making the same mistakes. What should I do
now? It takes time to develop good habits and break bad ones, so don’t give up.
Turn toward Christ. His grace is sufficient. Try again. You are never alone in
your efforts to progress. Jesus Christ is always with you.

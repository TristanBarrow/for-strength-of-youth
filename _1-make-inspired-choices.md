# Make inspired choices

In For the Strength of Youth, you will find the teachings of Jesus Christ and
His prophets. With these truths as your guide, you can make inspired choices
that will bless you now and throughout eternity.

Jesus Christ is the way to eternal joy. As you use your freedom to choose to
follow Jesus Christ, you are on the path that leads to eternal happiness. Make
Jesus Christ your standard, your rock- solid foundation. Build your life on His
teachings, and measure your choices by them. The covenants you make at baptism,
during the sacrament, and in the temple are the building blocks of your firm
foundation in Christ. You’ll still face struggles and temptations, but Heavenly
Father and the Savior will help you through them all.

You are a beloved spirit child of God. His great plan of happiness makes it
possible for you to grow spiritually and develop your divine potential. This is
why He sent Jesus Christ to be your Savior.

Your Father in Heaven trusts you. He has given you great blessings, including
the fulness of the gospel and sacred ordinances and covenants that bind you to
Him and bring His power into your life. With those blessings comes added
responsibility. He knows you can make a difference in the world, and that
requires, in many cases, being different from the world. Seek your Heavenly
Father’s guidance as you make choices. He will bless you with inspiration
through the Holy Ghost.

The purpose of For the Strength of Youth is not to give you a “yes” or “no”
about every possible choice you might face. Instead, the Lord is inviting you
to live in a higher and holier way—His way. This guide will teach you about His
way. It explains truths He has revealed. Make these truths your guide for
making choices— big choices, like making covenants in the temple and serving a
mission, as well as daily choices, like how to treat people or how to spend
your time.

While others can help you, your spiritual growth is personal. It’s between you
and the Lord. He knows your heart, and only He can be the ultimate Judge. Do
your best to improve each day, keep God’s commandments and honor your
covenants, and help others come closer to the Savior.

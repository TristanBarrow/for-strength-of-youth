# Truth will make you free

John 8:32

Your Heavenly Father is a God of truth. He is all-knowing. All truth comes from
Him and leads to Him. You show that you value truth as you seek learning, live
with integrity, and bravely stand for what you know is right— even if you have
to stand alone.

## Eternal Truths

Heavenly Father wants His daughters and sons to always be learning. You have
both temporal and spiritual reasons to seek and love learning. Education is not
just about earning money. It is part of your eternal goal to become more like
Heavenly Father. Living with integrity means that you love truth with all your
heart—more than you love personal comfort, popularity, or convenience. It means
doing what is right simply because it is right. You have something precious to
share. The gospel of Jesus Christ holds the answers to life’s questions. It is
the way to peace and happiness. You may not know everything, but you know
enough to help others understand and value true, eternal principles.

## Invitations

Always be learning. Look for opportunities to expand your mind and your skills.
These opportunities can include formal education at school or vocational
training, as well as informal learning from sources you trust. Involve the Lord
in your efforts, and He will guide you. As you learn about the world around
you, learn also about the Savior, who created the world. Study His life and
teachings. Make seminary, institute, and personal gospel study part of your
lifelong learning.

Love the truth so much that you would never want to steal, lie, cheat, or
deceive in any way—at school, at work, online, everywhere. Be the same faithful
follower of Jesus Christ in public and in private. Be a light for others. Let
your words and your actions reflect your faith in Jesus Christ. Prepare now for
future opportunities to share His glorious gospel, as a missionary and
throughout your life. And be ready to tell anyone who asks you about the hope
and happiness you feel.

## Promised Blessings

Education increases your ability to serve the Lord. It empowers you to bless
others, especially your family. The more you learn, the more you can help build
God’s kingdom and influence the world for good.

Honesty brings peace and self-respect. When your words and actions align with
truth, you show that you can be trusted—by other people and by the Lord.

When you stand up for the teachings of Jesus Christ, He stands with you. Others
may not agree with you, but your courage and sincerity will be noticed. Whether
or not others follow your example, your testimony, confidence, and faith in
Christ will grow.

## Questions and Answers

Is it wrong to have questions about the Church? How can I find answers? Having
questions is not a sign of weakness or lack of faith. In fact, asking questions
can help build faith. The Restoration of the gospel started when 14-year-old
Joseph Smith asked questions with faith. Seek answers in the scriptures, in the
words of God’s prophets, from your leaders and faithful parents, and from God
Himself. If answers don’t come right away, trust that you will learn line upon
line. Keep living by what you already know, and keep seeking for truth.

How can I stand up for what is right without offending those who have different
beliefs? Start by making sure your words and actions are inspired by love for
God and His children. Sharing the gospel should not be done in a spirit of
contention but rather with clarity, meekness, and kindness. You can be loving
toward others even if you don’t agree with their views.

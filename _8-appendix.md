## Appendix

One way to assess your progress on the covenant path is to ponder the questions
below. They are the questions you are asked when you are interviewed to receive
a temple recommend, but don’t wait for an interview. Do your own spiritual
checkup. The Young Women Theme, the Aaronic Priesthood Quorum Theme, and the
Ten Commandments can also be helpful tools in your self-evaluation.

## Temple Recommend Questions for Youth

Do you have faith in and a testimony of God, the Eternal Father; His Son, Jesus
Christ; and the Holy Ghost?

Do you have a testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and of His role as
your Savior and Redeemer?

Do you have a testimony of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ?

Do you sustain the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
as the prophet, seer, and revelator and as the only person on the earth
authorized to exercise all priesthood keys?

Do you sustain the members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators?

Do you sustain the other General Authorities and local leaders of the Church?

The Lord has said that all things are to be “done in cleanliness” before Him
(Doctrine and Covenants 42:41). Do you strive for moral cleanliness in your
thoughts and behavior?

Do you obey the law of chastity?

Do you follow the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ in your private and
public behavior with members of your family and others?

Do you support or promote any teachings, practices, or doctrine contrary to
those of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?

Do you strive to keep the Sabbath day holy, both at home and at church; attend

life in harmony with the laws and commandments of the gospel?

Do you strive to be honest in all that you do?

Are you a full-tithe payer?

Do you understand and obey the Word of Wisdom?

Are there serious sins in your life that need to be resolved with priesthood
authorities as part of your repentance?

Do you consider yourself worthy to enter the Lord’s house and participate in
temple ordinances?

## Young Women Theme 

I am a beloved daughter of heavenly parents, with a divine nature and eternal
destiny.

As a disciple of Jesus Christ, I strive to become like Him. I seek and act upon
personal revelation and minister to others in His holy name.

I will stand as a witness of God at all times and in all things and in all
places.

As I strive to qualify for exaltation, I cherish the gift of repentance and
seek to improve each day. With faith, I will strengthen my home and family,
make and keep sacred covenants, and receive the ordinances and blessings of the
holy temple.

## Aaronic Priesthood Quorum Theme

I am a beloved son of God, and He has a work for me to do.

With all my heart, might, mind, and strength, I will love God, keep my
covenants, and use His priesthood to serve others, beginning in my own home.

As I strive to serve, exercise faith, repent, and improve each day, I will
qualify to receive temple blessings and the enduring joy of the gospel.

I will prepare to become a diligent missionary, loyal husband, and loving
father by being a true disciple of Jesus Christ.

I will help prepare the world for the Savior’s return by inviting all to come
unto Christ and receive the blessings of His Atonement.
